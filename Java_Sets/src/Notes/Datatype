NON-Primitive Datatype (Reference)

=> contain a memory address of variable values because reference types wont store variables values directly in memory
=> Stored in string, objects, arrays etc


*** String =>

=> array of Characteres
=> designed to hold sequence of char in single variables
=> cannot be modified after creation
=> USe stringBuilder or Stringbuffer for String manipulation


*** Class =>

=> user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created
=> set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type

Class Declaration =>

1. Modifier = public or default access
2. Class name
3. Superclass = name of class's parent , using keyword extends, only for one parents
4. Interface = list of interfaces implemented by class
5. Body


class Car {

    String model;
    int year;

    Car(String model, int year){
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;

      }

      void display(){
           sout(model + " " + year);

        }

    }


*** Object =>
=> basic unit of OOPs and represents real-list entites.
=> typical java program creates many objects
=> interact by invoking methods


1. State : attributes of object. reflects properties of object
2. behavior : methods of object, response of an object to other objects
3. identity : gives unique name to object and enables one object to interact with other objects



*** Interfaces


*** Array =>
=> group of same type variables
=> arrays are objects in java,
=> direct super class of array type is object
