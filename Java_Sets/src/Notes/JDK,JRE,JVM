Difference between JDK,JRE,JVM

** JDK =>
- set of dev tools and libraries used to create java program.
- works with JVM & JRE to run and build java application

>> includes complier (javac) , debugger and utilities like jar and javadoc.
>> Provides JRE, allows running java program
>> required by developer to write, compile and debug code


*** Components of JDK :
1. JRE (JVM + Libraries)
2. Dev Tools (Compiler, jar, javadoc, debugger)

*** Note :
1. JDK only for developement.
2. JDK is platform depenedent.

*** Working of JDK :
1. source code(.java) = Developer write java program
2. compilation = JDK's compiler (javac) converts code into bytecode stored in .class file
3. Execution = JVM executes bytecode


** JRE =>
- Provides environment to run java programs on the system
- includes Standard Libraries and JVM
- dosent support compilation or debugging


Note:
1. JRE only for running application , not for developing
2. platform dependent

*** Working of JRE:

1. Class loading - loads compiled .class files into memory
2. bytecode verification - security and valiity of bytecode
3. execution - uses JVM (interpreter + JIT ) executes instructions and make system calls




** JVM =>
- responsible for executing java program
- responsible for converting bytecode into machine specific instructions

1. part of both JDK and JRE
2. Performs memory management and garbage collection

*** Note:
1. JVM platform dependent
2. Bytecode is platform independent , can run on any JVM
3. Modern JVMs rely on JIT compilation for performance





____________________________________________________________


*** Loading =>
> class loader loads bytecode into memory

*** Linking =>
> Performs verification, perperation, resolution

*** Initialization =>
> Executes class constructors and static initializers

*** Execution =>
> Interprets or complies bytecode into native code
